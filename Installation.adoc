== About this document

This document accompanies the main document for the tutorial "`A Tour
of the RISC-V ISA Formal Specification`", focusing just on the
installation steps needed before starting the tutorial.

Please either take Step A, or take both Steps A and B, depending on
your objectives, before starting the tutorial.

Step A:: Take this step if you just want to learn how to _read and
    consult the spec_.  This merely git-clones a certain repository
    which contains the Sail source code for the RISC-V ISA Formal
    Spec.

Step B:: Take this step if you also want to learn how to _execute the
    spec_.  This step will compile a RISC-V ISA simulator from the
    Sail formal spec, which you can use to execute:

* The standard suite of RISC-V ISA tests
* The standard RISC-V Compliance Test suite
* Any RISC-V ELF binary that you create from other source codes

== Installation Overview

This diagram provides an overview of the various components to be installed.

// ================================================================
== Step A: Installing for just reading the spec

Ensure you have `git` installed on your system.

Clone the following repository, which contains the RISC-V ISA Formal Spec in Sail:

----
    $ git clone https://github.com/rems-project/sail-riscv
----

What you get:

----
    $ cd sail-riscv
    $ tree -d
    ├── ...
    ├── ...
    ├── model
    ├── ...
    └── ...
----

The `model` directory contains all the spec files.

That's all you need, for just reading and consulting (not executing)
the spec (other than a text editor to view source code)!

// ================================================================
== Step B: Installing for also building executable version of the spec

The tool chain looks like this: opam -> OCaml -> Sail -> Executable version of RISC-V Formal Spec.

* The RISC-V Formal Spec is written in Sail, a Domain Specific Language (DSL) for ISAs.
* The compilers that produce executable versions of the spec are
    written in OCaml, a widely used functional programming language.
* Opam is the package manager for OCaml

*OS requirements*

These instructions are for Debian/Ubuntu Linux.  If you are running some other OS:

* You could install a virtual machine running Debian/Linux and follow these instructions.

* Opam, OCaml and Sail will also install on other OSes.  See the _Safety net_ websites (below)
  for more information.


*Safety net: more information on installing opam, OCaml and Sail*

The instructions below document are excerpted from:

* Installing opam: https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html[]

* Installing Ocaml for Sail, and installing Sail: https://github.com/rems-project/sail/blob/sail2/INSTALL.md[]

// SECTION ================================================================
== Step B.1: Install opam, the package manager for OCaml

Opam is the OCaml package manager.  You can install it using your
system's package manager. E.g., on Ubuntu or Debian:
----
    $ sudo apt-get install opam
----

More detailed installation instructions are on the opam website at https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html[].

Your opam version must be >= 2.0.

// SUBSECTION ----------------------------------------------------------------
=== Verify successful opam installation

----
    $ which opam
    /usr/local/bin/opam

    $ opam --version
    2.0.7
----

// SECTION ================================================================
== Step B.2: Install OCaml using opam

// SUBSECTION ----------------------------------------------------------------
=== Install OCaml

Environment setup:

----
    $ opam init
    $ eval $(opam env)
----

Install specific version of OCaml

----
    $ opam switch create ocaml-base-compiler.4.06.1
    $ eval $(opam config env)
----

// SUBSUBSECTION ----------------------------------------------------------------
==== Verify you've got OCaml

----
    $ which ocaml
    /home/nikhil/.opam/ocaml-base-compiler.4.06.1/bin/ocaml

    $ ocaml -version
    The OCaml toplevel, version 4.06.1
----

[NOTE]
====
According to https://github.com/rems-project/sail/blob/sail2/INSTALL.md[],
any version of OCaml from version 4.06.1 or newer is acceptable.
====

// ================================================================
== Step B.3: Install Sail using opam

// ----------------------------------------------------------------
=== Install Sail

First, please install certain prerequisite libraries needed by Sail (if not already installed on your system):

On Linux (Debian, Ubuntu, ...):
----
    $ sudo apt-get install build-essential libgmp-dev
    $ sudo apt-get install z3 m4 pkg-config zlib1g-dev
    $ sudo apt-get install git  rsync  unzip
    $ sudo apt-get install device-tree-compiler
    $ sudo apt-get install bubblewrap
----

[NOTE]
====
The `device-tree-compiler` is needed by the simulator.

Some people have reported needing `bubblewrap` on some OSs
====

Set up opam so it knows where to get Sail:
----
    $ opam repository add rems https://github.com/rems-project/opam-repository.git
----

Then, install Sail:
----
    $ opam install sail
----

// ----------------------------------------------------------------
=== Verify you've got Sail

----
    $ which sail
    /home/nikhil/.opam/ocaml-base-compiler.4.06.1/bin/sail

    $ sail --help
    Sail 0.13 (sail2 @ opam)
    usage: sail <options> <file1.sail> ... <fileN.sail>

      -o <prefix>                              select output filename prefix
      -i                                       start interactive interpreter
      ...
----

// ================================================================
== Step B.4: Build RISC-V simulators from the Sail spec

The RISC-V ISA Formal Specification in Sail can be compiled into an
executable simulator using which you can  execute RISC-V binaries.

[NOTE]
====
The RISC-V specification allows for implementations that
simultaneously support both RV32 and RV64, including dynamic switching
between these.  However, currently the simulators compiled from the
Sail Formal Spec must be statically configured for either RV32 or RV64
(this may change in the future).
====

// ----------------------------------------------------------------
===  Build an RV32 and RV64 RISC-V C-based simulator from the Sail spec

----
    $ cd sail-riscv
    $ make  ARCH=RV64  csim
    $ make  ARCH=RV32  csim
----

`ARCH=RV64` is the default; you can omit it from the command line.

The `make csim` command compiles the Sail spec to C and then compiles
the C code into the following executabes:
----
    c_emulator/riscv_sim_RV64
    c_emulator/riscv_sim_RV32
----
These simulators run fast enough to boot operating systems like
FreeRTOS, Linux, FreeBSD, etc. in a few seconds or minutes.

[NOTE]
====
During the builds, you may get some messages about incomplete pattern matches; you can ignore them.
====

[NOTE]
====
If you omit the `csim` makefile target, it will build all the targets,
which include an OCaml-based simulator and material for Coq, Isabelle,
HOL4, ... (not necessary for this tutorial).
====

// ----------------------------------------------------------------
==== Test-drive your RV64 and RV32 simulators (a smoke test)

Example: executing the `rv64ui-p-add` standard ISA test in the RV64 simulator:
----
      $ ./c_emulator/riscv_sim_RV64  test/riscv-tests/rv64ui-p-add.elf
      ...
      tohost located at 0x80001000
      ...
      Running file test/riscv-tests/rv64ui-p-add.elf.
      ELF Entry @ 0x80000000
      ...
      [0] [M]: 0x0000000000001000 (0x00000297) auipc t0, 0
      ...
      [1] [M]: 0x0000000000001004 (0x02028593) addi a1, t0, 32
      ...
      [2] [M]: 0x0000000000001008 (0xF1402573) csrrs a0, zero, mhartid
      ...
      [477] [M]: 0x0000000080000044 (0xFC3F2023) sw gp, 4032(t5)
      ...
      SUCCESS
----

During execution of the RISC-V binary, it prints out a trace of instructions executed.

Example: executing the `rv32ui-p-add` standard ISA test in the RV32 simulator:
----
      $ ./c_emulator/riscv_sim_RV32  test/riscv-tests/rv32ui-p-add.elf
      ...
      tohost located at 0x80001000
      ...
      Running file test/riscv-tests/rv32ui-p-add.elf.
      ELF Entry @ 0x80000000
      ...
      [0] [M]: 0x00001000 (0x00000297) auipc t0, 0
      ...
      [1] [M]: 0x00001004 (0x02028593) addi a1, t0, 32
      ...
      [2] [M]: 0x00001008 (0xF1402573) csrrs a0, zero, mhartid
      ...
      [472] [M]: 0x80000044 (0xFC3F2023) sw gp, 4032(t5)
      ...
      SUCCESS
----
