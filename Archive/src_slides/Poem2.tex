    \emph{To consider using an ISA Spec Formal;} \\
    \hmm \\
    \emph{But our future RISC-V tasks loom large and can terrify,} \\
    \emph{As CPUs, compilers and IPs we design and verify;} \\
    \hmm \\
    \emph{Greek symbol-laden formal specs may make us queasy,} \\
    \emph{But this one's different; it's really quite easy} \\
    \hmm \\
    \emph{Instead of passing out in shock, wheeled out on a gurney} \\
    \emph{This tutorial, we hope, for you, starts a more pleasant journey.}
